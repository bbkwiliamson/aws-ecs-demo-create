# aws-ecs-demo-create

ther are two files in this repo.

both files do the same thing. 

the first file create ecs cluster using CloudFormation yaml template.

the second file create the same ecs cluster using Terraform.

terraform is a well known Infrastructure As Code (IAC), CloudFormation is AWS IAC.

i use both of them, though with my team i use CloudFormation a lot. with my previous team we used Terraform 100%, now with my new team is CloudFormation 95%
